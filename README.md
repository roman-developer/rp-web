## rrp-web (Rails + React + Postgresql)

<b>rrp-web</b> is a base project to create a web application (monolith) using Ruby On Rails, ReactJs and Postgresql.

## Motivation

I have been motivated to build this application because I wanted to have a base project coded in Ruby on Rails but using React JS in some views. This is a base project that we could use as blueprint for build other projects in the future without the necessity to set up all the environment again.

## Tech/framework used

Built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React on Rails](https://www.shakacode.com/react-on-rails/docs/getting-started/).
- Ruby version: 3.1.2p20
- Rails version: 7.0.3

Database:
- PostgreSQL version: 14.3

Frontend:
- HTML, SCSS and ReactJS.

## Rails features

In this application I have used the following Rails features:
- Rails authentication with devise.
- CRUD for Post model
- Views in rails and react
